# Luxu Avatars

[Preview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFrsELRVuJA)

## What is this ü§î?

This FiveM resource enables developers to consolidate all player avatars in one central location.

## Why do I need this ü§®?

An increasing number of resources include player profile pictures and store them in unique ways, which can create challenges in accessing them for other resources.

## How does it work ü¶ä?

This resource addresses this issue by providing a dedicated script that allows players to change their profile picture. This change will synchronize with all other resources that leverage these exports, making it easier and more efficient to manage player avatars.

## Contribute and make it better üåê

This will only be as good as the community wants it to be.
